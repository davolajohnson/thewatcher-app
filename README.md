## Overview

**The Watcher App** is a personal movie and TV tracker that allows users to:

- Add movies or shows they want to watch, are currently watching, or have watched
- Organize titles into categories: *Want to Watch*, *Watching*, *Watched*, and *Recommendations*
- Edit or delete entries they own
- Use session-based authentication to protect and personalize their list

This app was built as a final project for a MEN Stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js) CRUD application with full authentication.
